# Python language to interpret geoscience data
Plan is to show the basic steps need to be followed in a step-wise manner to reach the formation evaluation stage.
All required logs are available for any type of basic geophysical analysis as example velocity (compressional, shear Vp, Vs), saturation (Sw), density (RHOB), Gamma (GR), porosity (NPHI, PHIE) etc.

I have inspired by various work of different people to name a few Matt Hall Agile GEoscience, Aadm and petroGG.
